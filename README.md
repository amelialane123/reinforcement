This Pacman MDP and reinforcement learning game was completed as a project for CS 370 (Intro to AI) at Duke University. 
I implemented value iteration and Q learning to enhance the efforts by Pacman to assure a success rate of greater than 80%.

My personal efforts are greatly shown in the files: valueIterationAgents.py, qlearningAgents.py
However I have a strong understanding of all of the published files.
